        <p>Chamonix is <em>the </em>place to go for alpine thrill seekers wanting to push themselves to the extreme. The resort is known the world over for its steep, challenging runs, off-piste powder, and dramatic mountain scenery. Its legendary 20-kilometre (12-mile) Valley Blanche is a high off-piste run, the longest in Europe, and a rite of passage for ballsy skiers on their way to becoming experts. Chamonix hosted the first ever Winter Olympics in 1924 and is considered by many to be the birthplace of alpine skiing. The resort is a large, yet attractive town offering both traditional charm and a lively nightlife.</p>
        <p>Chamonix ski resort is located a little over an hour form Geneva, one and half hours from Chambery, two hours from Turin and a little over two hours from Lyon. All these locations are serviced by major airlines. From these hubs, you can rent a car or take an airport transfer. Trains also move in between most of these locations.</p>
        <p><strong>The Mountain</strong><br>
          <br>
          Chamonix's ski area (<strong>1,035-3,842m</strong>) is spread across five mountains: <strong>Grands Montets</strong>, L'Aiguille du Midi, <strong>Le Brévent</strong> and <strong>La Flégère</strong> (lift linked) and <strong>Le Tour</strong>, so skiers must be prepared to travel if they want to ski multiple areas. The good news is that recent lift upgrades mean shorter queuing times.</p>
      <p>Chamonix is one of the giants for freeriding. The <strong>Aiguille du Midi</strong> and <strong>Grands Montets</strong> cable cars offer access to the off-piste powder on the glaciers<strong>. </strong>Freeriders will encounter some mind-blowing scenery along the way<strong> - </strong>deep crevasses, ice falls, clifftops, and caves.<br>
        <br>
        From the Aiguille du Midi (3,812m) you can see the French, Swiss and Italian Alps (including Mont Blanc on a clear day). This is the view just before skiing down the 20-kilometre Valley Blanche - a totally unmarked and unmaintained off-piste run.<br>
        <br>
        Freestylers describe Chamonix as one big playground with an abundance of natural freestyle terrain. There are also two snowparks and a half-pipe.<br>
        <br>
        Beginners and intermediates aren't left out in the cold; there are plenty of long green, blue, and red runs with reliable snowcover on which to practise turns.<br>
        <br>
      Chamonix makes up part of the <strong>Mont Blanc</strong> ski area. There are two ski passes to choose from: <strong>Chamonix Pass</strong> (€237/week) or the <strong>Mont Blanc Pass</strong> (€289/week).</p>
