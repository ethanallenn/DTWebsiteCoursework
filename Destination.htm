        <p>In 1741 two Englishmen, Windham and Pococke, discovered the 'Chamouny' valley and its glaciers. Their expedition was met by a rural population of mountain farmers, and a humble monastery. This community lived off animal husbandry and a sparse harvest of oats and rye.</p>
        <p>Windham and Pococke explored the valley and visited the Mer de Glace (Sea of Ice). The stories of their exploits, published in literary journals throughout Europe, started a craze to find out more about Chamonix.</p>
        <p>Madame Coutterand opened the first guest house in 1770.</p>
        <p>By 1783, celebrities such as Saussure, Goethe and Bourrit, had visited the valley and raised its profile. Around 1,500 visitors ventured to Chamonix each summer.</p>
        <p>Two local men Paccard and Balmat, made the first ever ascent of Mont Blanc in 1786.</p>
        <p>The first luxury hotel was built in 1816 (The Hotel de l'Union), followed by 'la Couronne', 'le Royal' and many more.</p>
        <p>In 1821, 'La Compagnie des Guides' was created following an accident on the MontÂ Blanc. Until the end of the 19th century, mountain guides were the main economic power in Chamonix.</p>
        <p>However, from the beginning of the 20th century with the construction of numerous hotels, the hotel industry become the predominant economic power in the valley.</p>
        <p>In 1860 a carriage road was built joining Geneva to Chamonix via Sallanches.</p>
        <p>In July 1901, the railway line that passes through the Chamonix valley was inaugurated. This opened the town to winter visitors.</p>
        <p>Between 1908 and 1910 Chamonix took on its present rhythm of winter and summer tourist seasons.</p>
